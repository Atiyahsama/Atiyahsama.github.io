abstract: |
  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for medically refractory cranial-cervical dystonia (CCD or Meige syndrome). However, clinical responses vary substantially across individuals, likely due to differences in electrode placement and modulation of target neural circuits.
highlights:
  - "Largest CCD-STN-DBS cohort analyzed with multi-level connectomic modeling."
  - "Optimal stimulation site for CCD is in the posterodorsolateral motor STN."
  - "Modulating fibers to cranial-cervical sensorimotor cortex improves outcomes."
  - "Symptom-based classification helps guide individualized DBS targeting."
